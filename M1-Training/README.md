# ADNI M1: Cognitive Status Classification (CN/MCI/AD) - Model Training

This repository contains the **training pipeline** for a machine learning model that classifies cognitive status into **Cognitively Normal (CN)**, **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**, and **Alzheimer's Disease (AD)** using clinical, cognitive, and biomarker data from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

The trained model is used in the companion app: [**ADNI M1-App**](https://github.com/cerevia-ai/ADNI-M1-App), a Streamlit dashboard for research and educational use.

> 🔍 **Note**: This tool is for **Research Use Only (RUO)** and not intended for clinical diagnosis.

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a transparent, reproducible, and evidence-based classifier that:
- Accurately distinguishes between CN, MCI, and AD
- Uses only widely available clinical and cognitive features
- Provides interpretable predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
